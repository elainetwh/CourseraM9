Background
========================================================
## Motor Trend Car Road Tests

1. The data was extracted from the 1974 Motor Trend US magazine, and comprises fuel consumption and 10 aspects of automobile design and performance for 32 automobiles (1973â€“74 models).

2. The data consists of 32 observations on 11 variables.

3. This application helps for understanding the dataset by exploring each variable in the dataset.

Variables Description
========================================================

1. An user selects the variables that provided in the side bar.
2. The description of the selected variables will be shown in the first section of the main panel (This is a reactive action).
3. The variables of the dataset are as follows.

```{r}
names(mtcars)
```

Data Distribution
========================================================

1. An user selects the variables that provided in the side bar.
2. The data distribution of the selected variables will be shown in the second section of the main panel (This is a reactive action).

```{r fig.width=7,fig.height=4}
hist(mtcars[,"mpg"], main="Variable 1", xlab="mpg", ylab="count")
```

Relationship between variables
========================================================

1. An user selects two variables in the side bar.
2. An user clicks the *Submit* button.
3. The relationship of the two selected variables will be shown in the last section of the main panel.

```{r echo=FALSE,fig.width=8,fig.height=4.5}
plot(mtcars[,"mpg"] ~ mtcars[,"disp"], main=paste("mpg vs disp"), xlab="disp", ylab="mpg")
```

Summary
========================================================

This application gives the following information of Motor Trend Car Road Tests Dataset (mtcars):

- Description of the variables
- Distribution of the values for each variable
- Relationship between two variables
